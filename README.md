I developed a project to develop a working website based on a layout. In the landing page of this page I :
1. Used the logo as a favicon;
2. Used the landing page name as a title;
3. All logos are links to the top of the page;
4. When you hover over the icons of links that lead to official sources of this product, they change the color of the icon and increase in size slightly;
5. All links are real links to any source of this product;
6. All images increase in size when hovered;
7. This landing page is suitable for viewing on a mobile device, tablet and desktop versions;
8. All nav__links work smoothly;
9. All form fields are required and have the correct types (email, tel, etc.);
10. The placeholders contain examples of what should be added to make the expected format clear;
11. The footer is "sticky" at the bottom with z-index: -1, resulting in a fixed background effect.
